    "### What is A/B Testing?\n",
    "\n",
    "A/B testing (or split testing) is a controlled experiment where two (or more) variations of a webpage, feature, or marketing campaign are tested against each other to determine which performs better.\n",
    "#### Common Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "Website Optimization: Testing different UI/UX designs to improve conversion rates.\n",
    "Marketing Campaigns: Comparing email subject lines, ad copies, or promotional strategies.\n",
    "Product Changes: Evaluating new features against existing ones before a full rollout.\n",
    "Algorithmic Adjustments: Testing new recommendation models in e-commerce.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Components of A/B Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "Control Group (A): The baseline (current version).\n",
    "Treatment Group (B): The new version with a modification.\n",
    "Random Assignment: Users are randomly assigned to groups to reduce bias.\n",
    "Performance Metrics: Metrics such as conversion rate, click-through rate, bounce rate, or revenue per user are tracked.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Statistical Foundations\n",
    "\n",
    "Null Hypothesis (H₀): There is no significant difference between A and B.\n",
    "Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): A statistically significant difference exists.\n",
    "Type I and Type II Errors:\n",
    "    Type I Error: False positive (detecting an effect when none exists).\n",
    "    Type II Error: False negative (failing to detect an effect when one exists).\n",
    "Statistical Significance: Typically, a p-value < 0.05 indicates statistical significance.\n",
    "Effect Size: Measures the magnitude of the difference between groups.\n",
    "Power Analysis: Determines the sample size needed to detect a meaningful effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Common Statistical Tests\n",
    "\n",
    "Chi-Square Test: Used for categorical data (e.g., conversion rates).\n",
    "T-Test: Compares means between two groups (independent samples t-test).\n",
    "Bayesian A/B Testing: An alternative approach that estimates the probability distribution of outcomes.\n",
    "Sequential Testing: Allows monitoring results as they come in to stop early if needed."
